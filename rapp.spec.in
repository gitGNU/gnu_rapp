# Strictly speaking, python isn't required when building for

# Older rpm build systems (rpm-build-4.4.2.3-3.fc9) apparently

%description
RAPP is a library of low-level image processing operations,
targeting mainly video analytics and computer vision applications.
The library is meant to provide an optimized and reliable computational
backend for such algorithms. The interface is designed to allow
hardware-accelerated implementations, while still being simple
enough for easy deployment from higher-level code.
