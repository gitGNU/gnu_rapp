 *  @brief RAPP library version handling.
 *
 *  The RAPP version is composed by two integers, @e VERSION.MINOR.
 *  Interfaces with different @e VERSION numbers are incompatible,
 *  while a change in the @e MINOR number is backwards compatible.
 *
 *  It is possible to check the RAPP version in both compile-time
 *  and in run-time. For compile-time checks, the macro constants
 *  #RAPP_MAJOR_VERSION and #RAPP_MINOR_VERSION can be used.
 *  To perform run-time checks, the constants #rapp_major_version
 *  and #rapp_minor_version can be used instead.
