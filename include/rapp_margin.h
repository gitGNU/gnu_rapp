/**

 *  @brief Horizontal and vertical logical margins.
 *
 *  Computes the logical @e margins of a binary image. The margin is
 *  defined as the logical inclusive-OR between all pixels in the rows
 *  (vertical) or in the columns (horizontal). The result is a binary
 *  image that consist only of one row or one column. The main use case
 *  is to compute the vertical margin and divide the image into
 *  horizontal blocks containing non-zero pixels that can be processed
 *  efficiently, while skipping the parts in between.
 *
 *  All images must be aligned.
