rapp-0.8dev: Prerelease for a future 0.8 release.
News and visible changes in this version, since the previous version:

- Pixelwise conditional thresholding: the threshold arguments
can now be not just scalars, but images, holding threshold
values for individual pixels.

- Pixelwise conditional operations: a scalar constant or a
separate image can now be added to an image, conditional on a
binary map image.

Fixed bugs:
Bug #40264, rapp_main.h misses the closing } for extern "C".

Bug #39396, incorrect overlap check for rapp_thresh_gt_u8,
rapp_thresh_lt_u8, rapp_thresh_gtlt_u8, and rapp_thresh_ltgt_u8.

Release rapp-0.7
News and visible changes in this version, since the previous version:

Changes regarding usage and related fixed bugs:
- Bugs exposed on MAC OS X (bug #31888 in the
savannah.nongnu.org database), causing wrong results and
spurious overlap indications.

- For rectangular structuring elements (the functions
rapp_morph_erode_rect_bin and rapp_morph_dilate_rect_bin), the
required padding in each direction now corresponds to the size
of the structuring element in that direction, not the size of
the maximum side.

- New vector backend, for Loongson-2E and -2F.
- New vector backend, for ARM NEON.
- New vector backend, for SPARC VIS.

Changes and fixed bugs affecting only build, test and installation:
- The size of a pointer, the preferred unit in absence of a
vector backend, now plays a part in the "platform" identifier,
which selects tunefiles etc.

- Tunefiles for sparc64, powerpc, powerpc64 and mips64el and their
vector backends have been added, reducing build time on native systems
and simplifying cross-builds.

- When configured with --enable-checking=asserted-returns,
the RAPP library will abort instead of returning an error code,
and will be built for debugging.

- Bug #31887, "make check" failing when building the test-suite,
exposed on MAC OS X.

- Bug #32618, causing build errors when using the AltiVec
backend with GCC (any non-Apple release).

- Bug #31874, breaking "make uninstall DESTDIR=/some/dir" (and
indirectly "make distcheck").

- Bug #32835, breaking "make all" for sparc64 at the final
benchmark step (i.e. before tunefiles were added).
