rapp-0.7dev: Prerelease for a future 0.7 release.
News and visible changes in this version, since the previous version:

Changes regarding usage:
- Bugs exposed on MAC OS X (bug #31888 in the
savannah.nongnu.org database), causing wrong results and
spurious overlap indications, have been fixed.

- New vector backend, for Loongson-2E and -2F.

Changes affecting only build, test and installation:
- Bug #31887, exposed on MAC OS X, has been fixed.

- Bug #32618, causing build errors when using the AltiVec
backend with GCC (any non-Apple release), have been fixed.

- Bug #31874, breaking "make uninstall DESTDIR=/some/dir" (and
indirectly "make distcheck"), has been fixed.

- Tunefiles for powerpc, powerpc64 and mips64el have been added,
reducing build time on native systems and simplifying cross-builds.

rapp-0.6: Initial public release.
