rapp-0.7dev: Prerelease for a future 0.7 release.
News and visible changes in this version, since the previous version:

Changes regarding usage and related fixed bugs:
- Bugs exposed on MAC OS X (bug #31888 in the
savannah.nongnu.org database), causing wrong results and
spurious overlap indications.

- New vector backend, for Loongson-2E and -2F.
- New vector backend, for ARM NEON.
- New vector backend, for SPARC VIS.

Changes and fixed bugs affecting only build, test and installation:
- Tunefiles for powerpc, powerpc64 and mips64el and their vector
backends have been added, reducing build time on native systems
and simplifying cross-builds.

- Bug #31887, "make check" failing when building the test-suite,
exposed on MAC OS X.

- Bug #32618, causing build errors when using the AltiVec
backend with GCC (any non-Apple release).

- Bug #31874, breaking "make uninstall DESTDIR=/some/dir" (and
indirectly "make distcheck").
